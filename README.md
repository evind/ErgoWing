# ErgoWing Mechanical Keyboard

ErgoWing is a custom design mechanical keyboard heavily inspired by the [ErgoDox](https://www.ergodox.io/)
and [Atreus](https://atreus.technomancy.us/) mechanical keyboards.

In this repo are the CAD files required to laser cut a case for this keyboard. Layer 1 is not
required. The thickness' I used for my case were:

* Layer 1: 2mm
* Layer 2: 4mm
* Layer 3: 5mm
* Layer 4: 5mm
* Layer 5: 2mm

This gives 10mm of space inside of the case for the bottom of the switches, teensy 2.0 and wiring.

There is no kerf accounted for in the CAD files - adjustments will need to be made based on the
kerf requirements of your cutting method/material used.

Please double check all dimensions if you plan to use these files.
